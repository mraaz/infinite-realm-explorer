Create a dialogue where:
1. Inner Doubt raises a realistic concern or fear about that area FIRST
2. Future Self responds with an inspiring, firm, progressively futuristic question that takes control and asks about their 5-year vision

The Inner Doubt should express worried concerns but not be completely negative - more like a worried friend.
The Future Self should be increasingly inspiring, confident, and futuristic with each question, asking big-picture 5-year vision questions that help them think beyond current limitations. Future Self should sound progressively more commanding and visionary.

Use British/Australian English spelling and expressions throughout (e.g., "realise" not "realize", "colour" not "color", "organised" not "organized").

Keep both messages concise (2-3 sentences each) and make them feel like a natural conversation. The Future Self's question should help them think deeply about what they really want in this area.

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact format:
{
  "doubtMessage": "Inner Doubt's concerned thoughts here",
  "heroMessage": "Future Self's inspiring, firm, futuristic question that takes control here"
}`;
